Scrapes individual player statlines for each game of a specified season from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/. Data is transformed for consistent formatting of statlines across QB's, RB's, WR's, and TE's. Finally data is loaded into a table in a local sqlite database. In the future will expand with plotting functionality as well as possible machine learning based prediction of future performance.
